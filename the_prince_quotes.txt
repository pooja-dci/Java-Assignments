And now here is my secret a very simple secret It is only with the heart that one can see rightly
what is essential is invisible to the eye
All grown ups were once children but only few of them remember it
The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched they are felt with the heart
Well I must endure the presence of a few caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies
You see one loves the sunset when one is so sad
It is such a mysterious place the land of tears
Only the children know what they are looking for
Grown ups never understood anything by themselves And it is rather tedious to have to explain things to them time and again
The thing that is important usually is the thing that is not seen
Sometimes our victories become our biggest defeats
But eyes are blind You have to look with the heart
I am who I am and I have the need to be
But the conceited man did not hear him Conceited people never hear anything but praise
Straight ahead you can't go very far
Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself
