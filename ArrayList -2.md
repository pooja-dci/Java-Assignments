Use the tvshows ArrayList and perform the following actions:
** Note: My sample output is provided for reference. Your output may differ based on your favorite tvshows list

1. Print the number of elements in the tvshows ArrayList:
```
Here are my top 8 favorite tv shows
```

2. Print the ArrayList tvshows using ```System.out.println(tvshows);```. See what it prints

```
[The Office, Seinfeld, Friends, Parks and Rec, Silicon Valley, Zindagi Gulzar Hai, Saans, Planet Earth]
```

3.Check if "Friends" is one of the tvshows I like:
HINT: use the .contains() method of ArrayList
```
Is Friends one of my favorite tvshows ? : true
```
4. Print the first element in the ArrayList
```
My first favorite tv show is The Office
```
5. Print the last element in the ArrayList by accessing it's index using the size() method 
```
I watch Planet Earth as a last resort
```
6. Replace a tvshow with something else
- HINT: use the .set() method to replace that index element
- I no longer like "Saans" so I replaced it with "Fuller House". My tvshows list looks like this now:
```
[The Office, Seinfeld, Friends, Parks and Rec, Silicon Valley, Zindagi Gulzar Hai, Fuller House, Planet Earth]
```
7. "The Crown" has become my top favorite tvshow. I will insert it as the first element in my arrayList and move everything else to the right. 
My tvshows list looks like this now:
```
[The Crown, The Office, Seinfeld, Friends, Parks and Rec, Silicon Valley, Zindagi Gulzar Hai, Fuller House, Planet Earth]
```
8. Check if tvshows is empty
```
I don't like watching tvshows : false
```
9. I should concentrate on work and stop watching tv shows. Adulting is hard! Clear the tvshows ArrayList
10. Print the tvshows ArrayList and its size
```
[]'s size is : 0
```
