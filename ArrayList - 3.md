1. Create an ArrayList of integers
2. Add a few elements to it
3. Print the ArrayList
4. Sort the ArrayList
- HINT: There is a class called `Collections` in java.util library. It has a ***static method*** called ```sort```. You can pass the ArrayList as a ***parameter*** to the sort method and it'll sort it for you
5. Print the ArrayList
5. Remove all even numbers from the ArrayList
- HINT: You have to loop through the arraylist using ```ListIterator```. ListIterator has a ```.remove()``` method
6. Print the ArrayList

Sample Output:
```
Initial List:
[49, 13, 18, 70, 25]
List in sorted order:
[13, 18, 25, 49, 70]
List after removing even numbers:
[13, 25, 49]
```
