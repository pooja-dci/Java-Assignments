1. Create an ArrayList of integers
2. Add a few elements to it
3. Print the ArrayList
4. Remove all even numbers from the ArrayList
- HINT: You have to loop through the arraylist using ```ListIterator```. ListIterator has a ```.remove()``` method
5. Print the ArrayList

Sample Output:
```
Initial List:
[13, 18, 25, 49, 70]
List after removing even numbers:
[13, 25, 49]
```
